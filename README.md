This project will start by relying on Megan Fazio, Kyle Fisher, and Tori Fujinam's work at Stanford titled:
'Tennis Ball Tracking: 3D Trajectory Estimation using Smartphone Videos'

See here for their project report: https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee368/Project_Winter_1718/Reports/Fazio_Fisher_Fujinami.pdf

I first want to try and reconstruct the ball position and speed during a point. This requires tracking the ball, and knowing the court lines to estimate the ball position.

Starting with the court lines.
